              <h1>The scoopScoopScoop 2 on NJD Bakery:</h1>

              <p>I like to make tasty things. I like to make people smile. I like to make people smile with tasty things I make. You think eating my stuff is about YOU? Nope, no altruism here. Seeing others take pleasure from something I created is completely a selfish endeavor on my part. So I make/bake/create and then give myself a big old self satisfied pat on the back knowing it brought someone a little pleasure. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="middle-content-container">
              <h1>So what's the whole "to eat well is to live well" business...?</h1>
              <p>Brace yourself: Food can taste good and not be horrible for you.</p>
              <p>Wait...WHAT?!</p>
              <p>Yep.</p>
              <p>Although NJD Bakery does specialize in a whole host of crazy tasty things that are likely not the best for you (90% butter and sugar, you know the drill), there are also many things that, although still tasty, will not make you feel like death, nor add to your health bills. </p>
           </div>
           <div class="bottom-content-container">
             <h1> How can this be?</h1>
             <p> The key is to use naturally occuring things that taste delightful. They're plopped all over the planet, just waiting to be utilized. Like dates. Dates are squishy bombs of sweetness that transform an 'eh, could-be-good-but-needs-something-else' treat into a 'holy-crap-this-is-the-best-thing-I've-ever-tasted!' treat. And, often, unbeknownst to the folks partaking in the consumption of the holy-crap-this-is-the-best-thing-I've-ever-tasted treat, is that what they're eating has no added processed sugar. That's right: they don't even know/can't tell. Take that taste buds. </p>
            <p> So whether you're looking to eat some good old fashioned butter and sugar laden goodness, or are looking more for something equally as tasty but on the healthier side, you have come to the right place.</p>
